Simple half-assed mobile substrate tweak for AppleTV 2G that injects into the AppleTV.framework Private Framework in ATVSWUpdateCheckTask to make sure the task is never actually performed, in the future i would like to make the Update Block in nitoTV work off of this and then have this read some kind of a default value from 'mobile' user preferences.


To build: 

1: ./setup.sh
2: make

done ;)
